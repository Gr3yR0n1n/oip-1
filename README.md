This is an update and modification of th OIP project to run on a Debian 7.0.

I took the original code from https://it.wiki.usu.edu/OIP and try to run it, but unfortunately it didn't work.
I changed some c++ calls and now it compiles and works fine.

You need to install these on debian-based distros:

apt-get install libsdl2-dev
apt-get install libsdl-image1.2-dev

It was and still is a GPLv3 project, so enjoy and have fun.

Thanks to the usu.edu for the project.

sebas garcia (eldraco@gmail.com) made the small modifications and the github code.
